LOCATED OFF A DESOLATE STRETCH OF INTERSTATE 50, DESPERATION, NEVADA HAS FEW CONNECTIONS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT IS A PLACE, THOUGH, WHERE THE SEAMS BETWEEN WORLDS ARE THIN. MINERS AT THE CHINA PIT HAVE ACCIDENTALLY BROKEN INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION AND RELEASED A HORRIFIC CREATURE KNOWN AS TAK, WHO TAKES HUMAN FORM BY HIJACKING SOME OF THE TOWN'S RESIDENTS. THE FORCES OF GOOD ORCHESTRATE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THIS ANCIENT EVIL AND A GROUP OF UNSUSPECTING TRAVELERS WHO ARE LURED TO THE DYING TOWN. THIS RAG-TAG BAND OF UNWILLING CHAMPIONS IS LED BY A YOUNG BOY WHO SPEAKS TO GOD.
